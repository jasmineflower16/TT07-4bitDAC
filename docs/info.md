## How it works

The goal of this project is to design a binary-weighted DAC using ideal operational amplifier designed in Verilog. A binary-weighted DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) is a type of DAC that uses binary-weighted resistors or current sources to convert a digital input into an analog output.

## How to test

This integrated circuit is tested by measuring the analog output signal of all combinations of digital inputs b0, b1, b2 and b3 generated from signal generator. 

## External hardware

A multimeter to measure the output voltage.
